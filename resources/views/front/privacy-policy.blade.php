                    We are concerned with keeping your data secure and protecting it from inappropriate disclosure. We
                    implement a variety of security measures to ensure the security of your Personal Data on our systems,
                    including Dijii Ltd has a Data Protection Policy implemented within the business. Staff with access to
                    personal data undertake regular data protection awareness training and must use strong passwords for
                    access to Dijii's systems. Up to date antivirus software is on all digital devices to protect computers,
                    networks, programs, and systems from cyberattacks. All software is regularly updated. Firewalls are in
                    place and updated regularly to apply the latest software patches. Data is stored and backed up in the
                    cloud with secure authentication requirements. Confidential and personal information is disposed of
                    securely such as the use of cross-cut shredders. . Any Personal Data collected by us is only accessible
                    by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems and are bound by
                    obligations of confidentiality. If and when we use subcontractors to store your data, we will not
                    relinquish control of your Personal Data or expose it to security risks that would not have arisen had
                    the data remained in our possession. However, unfortunately no transmission of data over the internet is
                    guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of Dijii
                    Ltd to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to
                    protect your Personal Data, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Personal Data you transmit
                    to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk. If you believe that your interaction with us is
                    no longer secure, please contact us.

                    (whether contractual or otherwise). If anything contained in an email from a Dijii Ltd address
                    contradicts anything in this policy, our terms or any official public announcement on our website, or is
                    inconsistent with or amounts to a waiver of any Dijii Ltd rights, the email content will be read down to
                    grant precedence to the latter. The only exception to this is genuine correspondence expressed to be
                    from the Dijii Ltd legal department.
